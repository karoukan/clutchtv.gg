- Video files are pretty big (~500MB per 30min game)
- Make sure League runs in Borderless or Windowed mode (fullscreen won't work)

## Troubleshooting

**Recording didn't start?**

- Check ClutchTV is actually running

**No events on timeline?**
- Games under 5 minutes won't have events
- Practice Tool isn't supported
- Your firewall might be blocking port 2999

**App crashes or won't launch?**
- Try running as administrator
- Check if you have the latest Windows updates
